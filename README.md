# infrastructure-migrations

This repository documents real-world infrastructure migration scenarios
performed in a large enterprise environment.

All system names, values, and identifiers are fully anonymized.
The content is intended for educational and professional portfolio purposes.

## Scope

The repository covers **infrastructure-level migrations**, including but not limited to:

- Messaging systems
- Databases
- Search and analytics platforms
- Supporting infrastructure components

The focus is on **process, decision-making, risks, and validation**, not on vendor-specific secrets or internal implementations.

---

Each migration scenario typically includes:
- migration overview
- architecture description
- prerequisites
- step-by-step procedure
- validation checklist
- rollback strategy
- lessons learned

---

## What This Repository Is

- A collection of **production-grade migration runbooks**
- A demonstration of **DevOps / SRE thinking**
- A structured knowledge base for recurring infrastructure tasks

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

- A dump of internal company documentation
- A source of proprietary configurations
- A data migration archive
- A vendor endorsement

---

## Design Principles

- **Safety first** — rollback and failure scenarios are explicitly documented
- **Reproducibility** — steps are deterministic and verifiable
- **Minimal assumptions** — environment-specific details are abstracted
- **Operational clarity** — written as runbooks, not tutorials

---

## Intended Audience

- DevOps Engineers
- Site Reliability Engineers
- Platform Engineers
- Infrastructure Architects
